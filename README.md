# MDBSocials
MDB project 3!

In this project, you can sign up and log in as users and see a list of events you can go to! The events are listed with the most recent on top, so you don't have to worry about going to some event that happened a week ago. Unfortunately, the poster name is still hashed (but accurate at least!), but you can still smack that interest button to show your love for the anonymous poster. Furthermore, you can even create your own cute event (though the picture functionality is a bit broken right now) and become a social media god! Have fun playing with it (or not if you're an introvert).
